    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Demetrius. I usually go by Jimmy as my name is Greek, and it translates to Jimmy.
        I am a upcoming application and software developer. The first time sofware, or application development
        entered my life was when MySpace was created. My friends and I always loved messing around with the code
        on our local machines. It eventually grew into a hobby and I took my skills into G-Coding for CNC machines.
        Later in life, late in life, I started to mess with C++ and C# with video games and it became a hobby again.
        My family was so impressed, they encouraged me to pursue it. Fast forward to know, I have gained multiple 
        skills and certificates in various forms of languages. Below will be the list of education, skills, and experience.
